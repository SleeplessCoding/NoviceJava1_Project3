This application is using a while loop to validate that the user inputs are within the conditional accepted range for the variables color, seats, and liters.

Pseudocode:

START {

Import JOptionPane

Create assignment class for getters/setters

Declare 3 attributes (color, seats, and liters)

Declare 3 accessor methods and 3 mutator methods (getters/setters)

Create a constructor with parameters and objects so we can assign attributes within our main

} END

Main class START {

Create variables for user input

While (the input data is invalid range) {

Ask User to enter starting values for the attributes

If the values are within the allowed conditions of the while condition statement then program continues

}

^^^ this will be done for each attribute value the user inputs (3 attributes color, seats, and liters)

Declare our constructor to use with getters/setters

Use getters to display user inputs system prints results to user

} END



An application designed to allow a customer to order a vehicle by type, color and liter options.
